# Country_Explorer
To find country details

1. When we open the file(index.html) and run it we see the home page.
2. The file(detailspage.html) is a new webpage for showing particular Country details, when we click on country name in a table which is shown in home page.
3. "sessionStorage" is used for persist the Get request response, To use it for all the other pages and while reloading the page.
4. I have commented all the JS and CSS assets.
